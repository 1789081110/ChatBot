Chat Master is a web application chatbot created using the Streamlit app where I created a few functions for getting user input and generating output. In my generate_response function, I have connected my bard API token to generate the response for any text question that is asked. The get_text function has a text field for the user to type the question/chat. I am saving these outputs generated before using the markdown library which shows us our previous Q&A I have used multiple conditional statements which sets the condition in which order the output should display on the web page.so I created two session states past and generated where the past output/response is displayed on the down and the new/latest query is displayed on the top by using the for loop we can display all the responses and questions in order. I connected the bard cookies value(token value from the application of bard) which is used for generating output/responding output for the given input. I have also added a function using the Tesseract which can extract text from images which can be sent as input text by giving an upload option to the model.
