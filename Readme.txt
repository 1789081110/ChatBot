Chat Master is a chatbot created using the Streamlit app where I created a few functions for getting user input and generating output. I connected the bard cookies value(token value from the application of bard) which is used for generating output/responding output for the given input. I have also added a function using the Tesseract which can extract text from images which can be sent as input text by giving an upload option to the model.
